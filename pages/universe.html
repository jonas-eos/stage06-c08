  <h2>The Universe</h2>
  <p>
    The word Universe derives from the Latin universum. The Latin word was used by Cicero, and later by others authors
    in a same sense as it is used today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum - first used by
    Lucretius in Book IV of his "About Nature of things" - which connects un, uni(a) with vorsum, versum (meaning
    "something turned, rolled or changed").
